Modifying AVO modlist and modifying it to be new base for Requeim-WTF
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Wabbajack to install modlist AVO.

Create a separate portable install of Mod Organizer (v2.4.4)
Copy over profiles, set profile name you want, remove others, etc (not detailed here)
Copy over Plugins:
  crashlogtools
  rootbuilder
Copy over Tools:
  BethINIStandalone
  CAO
  DynDOLOD
  SSEEdit4.0.4
  xLODGen
Copy over modOrganizer.ini and edit it to correct directory paths, etc
  Not detailed here as it's situation dependent; see also: later in this doc about removing executable definitions, etc. 


Open Mod Organizer in your new instance, and start uninstalling mods as detailed below.
(and deleting the corresponding download from MO dowloads/ folder)

Note:
Mods are removed from the AVO set for many reasons: 
- using/being-about Creation Club (not supported by requiem)
- having conflicts with Requeim (any, even tiny ones; minimize patching)
- making opinionated gameplay changes (vs. just visual changes)
- causing patch requirements if more mods added (let people extend without patching where possible)
- being a dependency in custom AVO patch (removing use of AVO custom patches completely)
- missing texture errors in LodGen, or any other issue
- being ENB-focused additions (replaced with non-enb versions where possible)
- being a one-off custom alteration mod (maintainance concerns, if mod is never updated again)
- doing one small, displensible thing and incidentally creating any kind of issue/conflict/concern of any kind
- requiring external tools/patchers/etc that complicate ability to do custom post-install extensions
- anything making "everyone either wants this change or can live with it" decisions where that assumption might not be true

Note: 
This modlilst is now disconnected completely from AVO source, even though all AVO custom work is published as public Nexus downloads.
I don't use his patches, etc, and none of the Wabbajack config/setup/info is the same (and I don't have acces to that anyway). 
Trying to keep mod in sync with AVO over time would be too big a job, so that's not planned.
If you like, you can think of this modlist as a forked-then-severely-altered version of AVO as it existed in Feb 2023, and off on it's own now.

Note: 
AVO uses "section" separators in Mod Organizer.
The following list refers to those sections using: "= <section title in mod organizer> =" 
Example: "= Major Patches =", refers to first secton in MO. 
The names are arbitrary, chosen by AVO author, kept as-is for easy comparisons with AVO source.

---------------------
Textures/DynDOLOD
---------------------
Must replace AVO generated texture/LOD files, as they're no longer valid.
Running game with AVO's files will cause random crashes as you move around world.
AVO files come from:
  https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62561)
  file: "AVO - Genned Outputs"
  Also contains "AVO - Nemesis" file, which we DO need, so don't delete from downloads.

Uninstall mods:
  AVO - xLodGen
  AVO - TexGen
  AVO - DynDOLOD
  

https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/t50dg5/looking_for_a_guide_for_xlodgen/
<quote>
If you're going to run xLODGen, the official suggested order is:
Run xLODGen first for Terrain only and enable.
Then run TexGen and enable.
Then DynDOLOD and enable.
Then run XLODGen again for Occlusion and enable (DynDOLOD can generate Occlusion, but xLODGen does it better).
</Q>

xLODGen textures/meshes:
Prepare:
  Download xLODGenResource - SSE Terrain Tamriel
   https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54680
  Put in "Master Files" section, put .esm just after "Unofficial" patches
  "Plugin needs to be active only while generating terrain LOD and should be removed or disabled afterwards." 
Run tools\xLODGen\xLODGenx64.exe (in MO2)
  Create output folder C:\skyrim\tool_output\xLODGen
  Adjust executable in MO, change output directory in arguments setting fo xLoDGenx64:
    -sse -o:"C:\skyrim\tool_output\xLODGen"
  Run, set options:
    Yes: select all worldspaces
	Set to do Terrain LOD only:
		No: Objects LOD
		No: Trees LOD
		Yes: Terrain LOD
		  Leave all settings at default, except:
			as in: https://lexyslotd.com/guide/finishing-line/#xlodgen (3/4 down)
		No: Occlusion
  Let run, takes about 10 min
  Copy files in output folder to Overwrite, use MO to "create mod" from overwrite:
     "RWTF - xLODGen terrain output"
  Put that mod at bottom of "Finishing Line Output" section and activate it.
  Zip mod directory as "RWTF - xLODGen terrain output.7z" and put in downloads folder.


Note: AVO runs "ACMOS Road Gen" to paint roads on map texture here. Skip that complication. 


TexGen textures/meshes:
Run tools\DynDOLOD\TexGenx64.exe
  tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=encZYHEeQrQ
  Create output folder C:\skyrim\tool_output\TexGen
  Run, set options:
    "Select Output Path" : set to C:\skyrim\tool_output\TexGen
    Leave all defaults
  Let run, takes about 10 min
  Copy files in output folder to Overwrite, use MO to "create mod" from overwrite:
    "RWTF - TexGen Output"
  Put that mod at bottom of "Finishing Line Output" section and activate it.
  Zip mod directory as "RWTF - TexGen output.7z" and put in downloads folder.



DynDoLod.esm, DynDoLod.esp:
Prepare:
  Remove/disable mod "xLODGenResource - SSE Terrain Tamriel" now if still installed. 
Run tools\DynDOLOD\DynDOLODx64.exe
  Create output folder C:\skyrim\tool_output\DynDOLOD
  Run, set options:
    Set output folder to C:\skyrim\tool_output\DynDOLOD
	  (Unlabeled text entry box under Low/Medium/High buttons in upper right)
	Click "Medium" button
    Leave all defaults
  Click OK button to run, let finish, takes around an hour or less
  When done, choose "zip and exit"
  Put file in downloads folder (so Wabbajack will be able to find it)
  Use MO to install and activate
	The .esm file goes LAST after all other .esm files
    The .esp file goes LAST after all other .esp files (except occlusion.esp from next step...)

Occlusion.esp:
Prepare:
  Reactivate mod "xLODGenResource - SSE Terrain Tamriel" 
  (not sure if this is useful/necessary, honestly)
Run tools\xLODGen\xLODGenx64.exe (in MO2)
  Run, set options:
    Yes: select all worldspaces
	Set to do Occlusion LOD only:
		No: Objects LOD
		No: Trees LOD
		No: Terrain LOD
		Yes: Occlusion
  Let run, takes about 10 min
  Find output file Occlusion.esp in MO "overwrite" directory, rename:
    "RWTF - xLODGen occlusion output.esp"
  Use MO to "create mod" from overwrite:
    "RWTF - xLODGen occlusion output"
  Put that mod at bottom of "Finishing Line Output" section and activate it (below everything)
  Zip mod directory as "RWTF - xLODGen occlusion output.7z" and put in downloads folder.
  Remove/disable mod "xLODGenResource - SSE Terrain Tamriel" again.
