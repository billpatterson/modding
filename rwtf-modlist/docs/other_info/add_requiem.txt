This document details changes made to install requiem into heavily modified shell of AVO.

Requiem Version: Requiem 5.3.1


Notation in this doc:
+ <mod name> 
means "add this mod in the noted section of Mod Organizer's mod list."


=== Requiem ===

In MO2, create new separator "RWTF - requiem" above "finishing line output" section
+ Requiem
+ Requiem - dragonborn patch
+ Requiem - Fozars Dragonborn 5.2.0 Fixes


=== Requiem Tweaks ===

Add in "+ Requiem" section in MO2, below Requiem:
+ Requiem - Small Tweaks SE mods: Knockdown Tweak

Note: other Small Tweaks mods make more intense changes not all players may like, and NPC Tweaks in particular may cause conflicts with other mods that modify the College vendors, some enemies, etc.

Note, 3Tweaks/etc:  
  Had to remove due to issues, e.g. "invisible vigilant body" that seems to be caused by Skyrim AE changes, etc.
  Should be compatible if you want to install it.
  Compatibility note: patch for sound mods this modlist uses:
    + AOS and ISC - FTweaks Patch (from FTweaks mod page in nexus)
    Put this in Requiem section


=== Creation Club ===

Add to top of "RWTF - Requiem" section:
+ Saints and Seducers Begone
+ Survival Mode Prompt Removed  ("permanently disable" version)

Discussion:

Requiem 5.3.1 includes FMOD installer option for Creation Club, but that requires ALL of the AE paid updated CC content (not just the 4 free AE version content items).

Also, the creation club content aspect of Requiem is "in progress", not "fully supported". 

Therefore, this modlist tries, as much as possible, to pretend CC content from Skyrim AE update doesn't exist. The content is turned off, disabled, blocked, etc wherever easily possible. 

In particular, Survival Mode is NOT integrated/usable/compatible out of the box. If you want to add support for it, you're on your own. Other CC content has (only) whatever compatibility is provided by Requiem.

If/when the base Requiem mod says "CC content is now fully integrated" I'll revisit this.

Note, "Survival Mode": 
Base AVO modlist contains a mod: "Survival Mode Improved - SKSE"
That was removed, as it has three bad side effects for requiem game:
 (a) survival mode always on by default
 (b) supresses skyrim "do you want SM on?" prompt
 (c) causes "carry weight max changes to zero" effect on entering skyrim worldspace (because Surivial Mode is on). 
Issue(c) is fixable by waiting for Unbound quest to complete, at which point Skyrim AE adds a setting at Settings > Gameplay > Survival Mode that you can use. 
Instead, the above reference "Survival Mode Prompt Removed" mod is used.
That keeps surival mode prompt from appearing, leaves survival mode off. 


=== Alternate Start ===

+ Alternate Start
+ New Beginnings - Live Another Life Extension SSE
Place above Requiem (plugins above Requiem.esp) in MO2

Disable AVO-AE item "optional quick start" :
- Uncheck/disable "Optional Quick Start - SE" mod in MO2 modlist
(left in until now, to facilitate testing during AVO editing process)


=== Sounds ===

Add new section in MO2, "RWTF - sounds"
Put between Mesh Fixes and User Interface sections

+ Audio overhaul skyrim 4.0.1
  Includes patches for True Storms, Enhanced Blood Textures
+ Immersive sounds compendium
  Lots of options, chose "slightly dialed back" options
+ Audio Overhaul Skyrim - Immersive Sounds Compendium Integration (1.1.0)
Put these in sounds section
Put the two AOS patch .esp's at top of Requiem section (so after other mods, before Requiem)

Note: required Sound Record Distributor already included in AVO base
      (do not remove that if removing AOS/ISC; needed for other AVO mods)
Note: requiem patch central includes patch for this

+ Immersive Sounds Compendium Drinking Sound Fix
(fixes silent-sound bug)


=== HUD ===

Move these AVO mods into new "RWTF - HUD" section: 
  UIExtensions
  moreHUD SE
  moreHUD Iventory Edition
  Ultimate Immersion Toggle
  A Matter of Time

Uninstall AVO's installation of SkyHUD (was installed with preset choices, don't want)
Uninstall AVO's installation of Infinity UI (not needed, removed Compass Nav Overhaul that required it) 

Add these new mods into "RWTF - HUD" section:  
"SkyHUD" files:
  + SkyHUD  (reinstall, choosing .esp version, NO preset)
  + Patch - SkyHUD  (file from SkyHUD nexusmods page) (over SkyHUD as patch, or as separate mod)

+ Honed metal community AE patch

Add at bottom of "Essential functionality" section in MO2:

Honed Metal note:
Base mod has not been updated for latest SKSE verion, and game launch will fail.
The "Honed Metal Community AE Patch" mod is a complete replacement.
The community patch is "unofficial" and should be replaced with actual mod once that's updated.

In base install described in this document, patches are included for:
 - Audio Overhaul and Immersive Sounds
