# Optional Additions

The mod's author uses several additional mods, and so these have been tested as "add ons" and confirmed to work with this modlist: 

## Misc 

Honed metal AE  
Put in "RWTF - Misc" group in MO2

Dynamic Things Alternative - Base Object Swapper  
Put in Fixes section in MO2

Fog Mesh Remover  
Put at very bottom (overwrites only retextures from "Little Things", safe to remove mid-game)

Magic Sneak Attacks  
Put with Honed Metal, Alt Start, etc

Requiem - Magic Sneak Attacks  
Put with Requiem patches


## Missives


Add in "RWTF - Misc" section:
+ Missives (base mod)
+ Missives notes retexture
+ Missives - Solstheim Patch SE
+ patch for Missives worldspace (Solstheim)
+ Missives the witcher board
(Put after JK's Skyrim mod, if using)

Note: "witcher board" gets overwritten/ignored if not at bottom of missives addons list.

Note: "Headhunter", "Requiem - RMB Patches - Headhunter - Missives"  
Installing this popular companion to Missives caused obtaining quests from Steward & Inkeeper to behave oddly. Should be compatible, though, so experiment if you like. 


## JK's Skyrim Exteriors

+ JK's Skyrim all in one  
Place mod/.esp in the "Settlements" section in Mod Organizer

+ Missive JK Skyrim  
After missives base mod, before missive add-ons and patches


## Spell Research

NOTE: Spell research must go above Requiem, then requiem, then requiem SR patches. 

Add "RWTF - spell research" section above Requiem section in Mod Organizer.

Add the folling mods to "RWTF - spell research" section:
+ Spell Research 2.2.2
+ Spell Research - Better Translation Tomes
+ Spell Research Book (experience book addon)
+ Spell Research Graphics 
+ Patch for enhanced Graphics for SR experience book
+ Spell Research Patch Compendium Redux Loose Version

Add the folling mods with other requeim patches:  
+ Spell Research - Requiem 5 patch

_Note:_

The SR requiem patch does *not* patch the vendors (staff) in the College of Winterhold to sell materials/tomes, and does not patch most "loot lists" to allow player to find SR-items in loot chests. 

TODO: I'm building a custom patch to fix this, but it's not available yet.

Note: 

SR does not do any modifications to default spells system or spellbooks. 

It can therefore be ignored completely, and player can just buy spellbooks as usual. The only effect is that you'll see some SR-related loot and items for sale ("Ancient Tome", etc).

There is a mod for "make spell books just show SR archetypes rather than teaching spell." If you want to use this, you will have to patch HEAVILY for Requiem compatibilty.


## Book Covers of Skyrim

AVO includes the mod "Book Covers Skyrim Updated", which is different than older "book covers of skyrim" mod. 

You therefore do _NOT_ want to install patches for the old mod:
- Requiem Dragonborn - Book Covers
- Requiem Patch Central patch

Ignore those, do not install them. 

There is currently no requiem patch for the newer BCS-Updated mod. 

Leaving "Book Covers Skyrim Updated" and putting requiem "last" in load order means some BCS-Updated changes will get inored, which is fine. 


## WACCF /ACE / CCOR

These mods are *intentionally not included* in the modlist.

Install if you like, but note [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/101g9i3/requiem_53_waccfaceccor_patches_updated) from the Requiem patch author, noting that future versions may not be patched.

Also, these mods are "patch generators" meaning they cause a need for patching due to conflicts with many other mods. They're good mods, you may want them, but they're intentionally left out of this modlist to reduce complications. 

## Campfire / Frostfall

As of this writing, these are being left out due to (a) changes not everyone may want, (b) need for patching with other mods users may want to add in, and (c) issues with current releases (particularly MCM/SKSE issues with interface to change settings). 

This may have improved by the time you're reading this. 

You are free to install, as working versions should not conflict with other things in this modlist (e.g. modlist disables Creation Club survival mode so that won't conflict, etc).
