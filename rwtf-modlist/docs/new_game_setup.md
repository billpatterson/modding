# New Game Setup

When starting a new game, you need to trigger Requiem activation, and pick a starting scenario.

You may also want to change some MCM settings in your game before going further. 


## New Game - Do This

Post-Game-Start Steps, new game:

1. Let all mod MCM's get recognized and loaded - wait until you're not seeing new messages incoming.

1. Do requiem install and let it finish (open & close inventory menu)

1. OPTIONAL: If using Spell Research: import spells now

1. Use MCM to set mod options you care about (see below for suggestions)  

1. Save game

1. Use/activate mara statue to select start (stadard Alternate Start mod process), then sleep in the bed to activate your choice


## Suggested MCM settings


_Take Notes:_

- Set open key to N
- Set new entry to N

_Requiem_: **Important**: 

- Atmosphere > Cell respawn time: 365 (default is 30)

_Requiem_: suggested:

- Atmosphere > Timescale : 14  
- Atmosphere > poisons without visuals  
- Atmosphere > fast travel allowed  

_SmoothCam_:  

If the in-game camera "floats" too much for your liking, turn off or try changing settings to half default value:  
- MCM > SmoothCam > Third Person > Interpolation > Min Follow Rate
- MCM > SmoothCam > Third Person > Interpolation > Max Follow Rate.

If that's still not enough, you can disable SmoothCam entirely.

(SmoothCam can at first seem jarring for people who have never used it, but is generally liked after allowing some time to adjust to it.)


_Spell Research_:  

If using _Spell Research_, hotkeys are often useful:
- Spell Research > Options > enable hotkey > Home  
- Spell Research Book Options > enable hotkey > End
