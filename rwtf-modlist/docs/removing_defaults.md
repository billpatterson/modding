# Removing Defaults

Several of the installed mods are intended to be easily removed if you don't want them.

This page describes installed mods that you can remove/disable without worrying about destabilizing the mod set.


## HUD and UI Mods

Some default HUD changes are made by RWTF. You can edit them to your liking by adding/removing mods.

### General UI Changes

These mods affect inventory/spell screens, dialog boxes, etc:
- SkyUI  
- Dear Diary Dark Mode (white text)  
- A Matter of Time  

These mods change start menu + music:  
- Vintage skyrim mainmenu replacer
- Main menu music replacer - Malukah

If you want to "clean reset" the UI, you'll want to remove those, as well as the Hud Alterations mods below.

You don't need to re-run the Reqtificator when adding/removing any of these UI mods.

 
### HUD Changes

To remove all HUD mods and start fresh to install your own, Deactivate or unistall from "RWTF - HUD" section:  
- moreHUD SE  
- moreHUD inventory edition  
- SkyHUD  
- Paramount versitile HUD presets  

No other changes necessary. Replace with your preferred HUD setup.

Note that *SmoothCam mod has some HUD settings!* See Smooth Cam in-game MCM if leaving this installed.

Re-running Reqtificator not necessary in this case, but doesn't hurt!

### HUD, Tweaking 

If you "mostly like" the HUD but want to tweak it, you can leave the HUD mods and edit:

  <skyrim data folder>/interface/skyhud/skyhud.txt 

Note that this file may be provided by several mods, so finding the "winning" copy to edit is important!

Mods known to provide a copy of this file: 

- Paramount - Versatile HUD Presets
- Dear Diary Dark Mode (white text)

In the default setup, Dear Diary Dark Mode comes last, so its copy of the file "wins" in load order. 

*Suggesion:* find the copy of the file you want to edit, copy it. Save the new copy as:

   <mod organizer folder>/overwrite/interface/skyhud/skyhud.txt
   
Edit that copy to have all your changes overwrite any copy of the file provided by mods.

See SkyHUD nexusmods page for information about settings you can alter.
